What is far more important is the evidence that IPNav's business, and patent trolling more generally, is a huge tax on innovation.\n<p>Thanks to trolls like IPNav, the <em>Times</em> explains, U.S. companies are forced to spend upwards of $30 billion every year on patent litigation. Most of that money goes to troll profits and legal expenses, with less than 25 percent flowing to inventors. Even Spangenberg concedes that his business uses “the courts as a marketplace, and the courts are horribly inefficient and horribly expensive as a market.” Patent trolls like IPNav are a symptom of a fundamentally broken system.\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/business/how-a-typical-patent-battle-took-an-unexpected-turn.html\">follow up article</a>, the <em>Times</em> tells the story of Peter Braxton and his app <a href=\"http://jumpropetheapp.com/\">Jump Rope</a>. In an <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2013/01/17/are-patent-trolls-now-zeroed-in-on-start-ups/\">all too common tale</a>, Braxton's promising start-up was devastated by a troll lawsuit (brought by a company not associated with IPNav). Even though Braxton won a clear victory at the district court, litigation costs were destroying his business. In exchange for a substantial equity stake in Braxton's company, IPNav agreed to handle the litigation. As the <em>Times</em> explained, this story suggests that “there is really only one way to deal with a patent bully: team up with a bigger bully.”\n<p>This is a terrible climate for innovation. We hope that media attention like this helps spur <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/legislative-solutions-patent-reform\">legislative reform</a>. We should create a patent system that doesn't squelch start-ups solely to enrich patent trolls. Erich Spangenberg doesn't need a seventh Lamborghini.\n</div></div></div><div><div>Related Issues: </div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/innovation\">Innovation</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/patent\">Patents</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/resources-patent-troll-victims\">Patent Trolls</a></div></div></div><div><br>Share this: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=The+Times+Profiles+a+Patent+Troll+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Ftimes-profiles-patent-troll\"><img alt=\"Share on Twitter\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/twitter.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Ftimes-profiles-patent-troll&t=The+Times+Profiles+a+Patent+Troll\"><img alt=\"Share on Facebook\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/facebook.gif\"></a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Ftimes-profiles-patent-troll\"><img alt=\"Share on Google+\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/gplus-16.png\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://identi.ca/notice/new?status_textarea=The+Times+Profiles+a+Patent+Troll+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Ftimes-profiles-patent-troll\"><img alt=\"Share on Identi.ca\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/identica.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=The Times Profiles a Patent Troll&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Ftimes-profiles-patent-troll\"><img alt=\"Share on Diaspora\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/diaspora-16.png\"></a>  ||  <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/join\">Join EFF</a></div>","direction":"ltr"},"unread":true},{"id":"55jQyVFBayOwBJQ5qCX8DsgTPumTnzjw6LozTAKPiWA=_13fe4b6e72f:1243ffd:e95a5f49","originId":"74988 at https://www.eff.org","fingerprint":"c04da56","title":"The EFF Guide to San Diego Comic-Con","published":1373927909000,"crawled":1373931759407,"alternate":[{"href":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/eff-guide-san-diego-comic-con","type":"text/html"}],"author":"Dave Maass","origin":{"htmlUrl":"https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml","streamId":"feed/https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml","title":"Deeplinks"},"summary":{"content":"<div><div><div><p><b><img height=\"350\" alt=\"\" align=\"right\" width=\"182\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/images_insert/poi-keycard-toldja.jpg?itok=sbc7Vsv3\"></b>With the arrival of summer at EFF, you can hear the excitement in the stuffing of luggage and locking of office doors as our team prepares for some of the most important conventions in the world. <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/event/black-hat-briefings\">Black Hat</a> starts on July 27, with <a href=\"https://www.defcon.org/\">DEF CON</a> immediately after. But before those two kick off, there's <a href=\"https://secure.comic-con.org/cci\">San Diego Comic-Con</a>, the largest celebration of the popular arts. For the first time, an EFF staffer will be pounding the plush conference carpet (and maneuvering around cosplayers) to take the pulse of the entertainment industry and catch up with some of our friends and fans.\n<p>After all, the geeks and nerds and fan-kids at Comic-Con are our peeps. In preparation, we threw together this quick guide to the panels that are bound to engage anyone following our issues, whether that's surveillance, free speech, or intellectual property.\n<p>If you're a creator with a booth at Comic-Con, drop me an email at <a href=\"mailto:dm@eff.org\">dm@eff.org</a>, and I'll swing by with some swag (as long as it lasts). If you're doing something EFF-friendly, maybe we'll even feature your work on our Deeplinks blog.\n<p>A quick note in advance on information safety: It's easy to lapse into the comfort of trust that comes with mingling with 100,000 like-minded folks. Still, you should take some basic precautions. If you're logging onto public Wi-Fi, make sure you use <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere\">HTTPS Everywhere</a>. Remember also that paying for goods in cash is always safer than swiping your credit card through a mobile device. Finally, when you’re signing up on mailing lists, or trading personal information for goodies, make sure to read the fine print about how that information will be shared.\n<p>Now for the fun stuff.\n<h3><b><u>For the Surveillance-Heads</u></b></h3>\n<p>As the U.S. chases Edward Snowden and his trail of NSA documents around the world, it’s worth contemplating whether truth has finally proved itself stranger than fiction. How can sci-fi even keep up with real world? Two TV shows and a video game have panels that, at least in some way, will touch on the issue.\n<p><b>Intelligence: </b>Let's imagine all the spying power of the NSA and more: direct access to the global information grid, WiFi, cell phones, satellites, all channeled through the brain of Sawyer from <i>Lost</i>, or at least Josh Holloway, the actor who played the sly con-man. That’s the premise of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/intelligence/\"><i>Intelligence</i></a>, a show set to start airing in February 2014 on CBS. Holloway and other members of the cast, and its executive producers, will sit on a panel moderated by the president and editor-in-chief of <i>TV Guide</i>.  The booth on the convention floor will also feature a special “experience” with Google Glass.\n<p><a href=\"http://sched.co/1246Iat\">Thursday, July 18, 10am to 11am - Ballroom 20</a>\n<p><b>Person of Interest: </b>With the third season starting this call, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.cbs.com/shows/person_of_interest/\"><i>Person of Interest</i></a> is about what happens when you combine predictive technology with big-data collected through video surveillance—and the secret operatives who act on the information. There will be a Q&amp;A with the cast on Saturday, but supervising producer Amy Berg will also talk about the realities of the show as part of panel on “science” in “science fiction.”  The CBS show this year has also sponsored hotel key cards (see above) that capture the sentiment at EFF these days in the wake of the NSA leaks.\n<p><em>The Science of Science Fiction  - </em><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sched.co/14UGZzt\">Thursday July 18,  6:30pm - 7:30pm - Room 24ABC</a>\n<p><em>Person of Interest Special Video Presentation and Q&amp;A - </em><a href=\"http://sched.co/14UGZzt\">Saturday July 20, 4:00pm - 4:45pm - Room 6BCF</a>\n<p><b>Watch_Dogs: Does Privacy Exist? </b>In this new, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://watchdogs.ubi.com/watchdogs/en-us/home/index.aspx\">cross-platform video game</a>, the user plays a hacker in Chicago with the power to manipulate the city’s digital infrastructure, including traffic signals and surveillance cameras.

At EFF, we've been engaged in lawsuits about these secret and unconstitutional NSA programs for the better part of a decade, and we need the government to see that the American people are outraged.\n<p>Because nearly 250 years ago today, our founding fathers refused to live under tyranny and declared independence from their ruling government. The king, they wrote in the Declaration of Independence, had made it impossible to live under a rule of law.\n<p>A few years later they wrote the document that established the United States of America, our Constitution, and with it they published our Bill of Rights to protect the basic rights that every person in this country is entitled to.\n<p>The actions of the National Security Agency spying on Americans, revealed by a series of whistleblowers driven by conscience, represents a break from that tradition. And it's our duty not to allow that break. It's our duty as human beings, entitled to dignity and privacy, and it's our duty as Americans, protecting those rights not just for ourselves but for everybody who follows in our steps.\n<p>The Founders wrote the Fourth Amendment deliberately, with a specific purpose: to ensure that so-called \"general warrants\" were illegal. These general warrants were broad and unreasonable dragnets, requiring anyone targeted to forfeit their information to the government.\n<p>No, under the Fourth Amendment, a warrant needs to be specific. You need a particular target and probable cause.\n<p>Compare that with what we know the NSA is doing, and has been doing for years. Even now we can't know the full scope of what the government is doing when it claims to act in our names, but we know about these four programs:\n<ul><li>The NSA obtains the telephone records of every single customer of phone companies like Verizon. They try to brush that under the rug by saying it's \"just metadata,\" but the invasiveness of that metadata can be truly astonishing: every single call, who is on both ends, how long they spoke, and more.\n<li>The NSA in some cases obtains the actual content of phone calls, effectively listening in on private conversations.\n<li>The NSA taps the very basic infrastructure of our net, sucking up the raw data and storing it for who knows how long, doing who knows what kind of analysis to it.\n<li>The NSA obtains content from major tech companies, many of whom are based right here in this city, including videos, email messages and more, based on a 51% chance—a guess, basically—that the \"target\" of the investigation is a foreigner talking to somebody in the US.\n</ul><p>Make no mistake: these programs are illegal. These are illegal under the Fourth Amendment, which we celebrate here today, and they are propped up only by outrageous and dishonest readings of laws that violate Congress' intentions.\n<p>And when the Director of National Intelligence was asked about these illegal programs on the floor of Congress, he flat-out lied about them, to Congress and to the American people. Once again, this government is acting in our name, but it refuses even basic accountability for its actions.\n<p>You don't lie to Congress to hide programs if you believe that they're legal. That's why we're demanding a few steps to once and for all shine some light on the activities of the NSA.\n<p>We want a full, independent, public Congressional investigation into what the NSA is doing, and what it claims it's allowed to do.\n<p>We want the public to see the secret legal decisions, made in a secret court, about what kind of surveillance the government's doing.\n<p>We want the public to see the Inspector General Reports about these programs.\n<p>We want to see how the government justifies these programs—that means any other reports about how necessary and effective they are.\n<p>And most importantly, we want public courts to determine the legality of these programs.\n<p>We think public courts will see through the NSA's torturing of the English language, and see that it's searching all of us, and seizing our data, in ways that are absolutely unreasonable.\n<p>Once the courts have reviewed these programs, we want the dragnet surveillance to stop. No more bulk collection of Americans' communication records, and no more open access to the backbone of the Internet.\n<p>In 1975, after widespread illegal activity by the NSA, the FBI, and the CIA, Senator Frank Church chaired a committee to examine that bad behavior and reign it in with new laws. It wasn't an easy road, but the Church Committee was able to establish some of the first real safeguards against these sorts of illegal activities. Frank Church was clear about why these were necessary:\n<p>If these agencies were to turn on the American people, Church said, \"no American would have any privacy left, such is the capability to monitor everything: telephone conversations, telegrams, it doesn’t matter. There would be no place to hide.\"\n<p>Those are powerful words. But it's up to us to ensure that those words are a battle cry in the fight for our privacy, and not the epitaph on its grave.\n<p>The Fourth Amendment is there to protect us, but there comes a time when we have to step in and protect it. The NSA has treated the Fourth Amendment and the rest of the US Constitution like a suggestion they're free to ignore. Today, we stand up, and we let them know: that is unacceptable. We, the American people, will not let ourselves fall under tyranny, and we will not let government agencies establish the infrastructure for turnkey totalitarianism.\n<p>We will push back, we will fight, and we will do whatever it takes to restore the Fourth Amendment and the rest of the U.S. Constitution. Thank you all for coming out today to send that message.</blockquote>\n</div></div></div><div><div>Related Issues: </div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/privacy\">Privacy</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying\">NSA Spying</a></div></div></div><div><br>Share this: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=EFF+Addresses+Protesters+at+San+Francisco%27s+%22Restore+the+Fourth%22+Protest+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Feff-rallies-protesters-restore-fourth\"><img alt=\"Share on Twitter\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/twitter.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Feff-rallies-protesters-restore-fourth&t=EFF+Addresses+Protesters+at+San+Francisco%27s+%22Restore+the+Fourth%22+Protest\"><img alt=\"Share on Facebook\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/facebook.gif\"></a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Feff-rallies-protesters-restore-fourth\"><img alt=\"Share on Google+\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/gplus-16.png\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://identi.ca/notice/new?status_textarea=EFF+Addresses+Protesters+at+San+Francisco%27s+%22Restore+the+Fourth%22+Protest+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Feff-rallies-protesters-restore-fourth\"><img alt=\"Share on Identi.ca\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/identica.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=EFF Addresses Protesters at San Francisco%27s %22Restore the Fourth%22 Protest&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Feff-rallies-protesters-restore-fourth\"><img alt=\"Share on Diaspora\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/diaspora-16.png\"></a>  ||  <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/join\">Join EFF</a></div>","direction":"ltr"},"unread":true},{"id":"55jQyVFBayOwBJQ5qCX8DsgTPumTnzjw6LozTAKPiWA=_13fe35125e9:d7f955:c159ab3d","originId":"74875 at https://www.eff.org","fingerprint":"61df9f7b","title":"Yahoo's Fight for its Users in Secret Court Earns the Company Special Recognition in Who Has Your Back Survey","published":1373905493000,"crawled":1373908313577,"summary":{"content":"<div><div><div><p>Each year, EFF’s <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013\">Who Has Your Back </a>campaign assesses the policies and practices of major Internet companies as a way to encourage and incentivize those companies <span>to take a stand for their users in the face of government demands for data. </span><span><span>Normally, when a compan</span></span><span><span>y demonstrates it has a policy or practice that advances user privacy, like fighting for its users in courts, we award the company a gold star. </span>Sometimes, even when companies stand up for their users, they're forbidden from telling us about it because of unduly restrictive secrecy laws or court orders prohibiting them from doing so. </span><p><span><img height=\"79\" width=\"85\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/images_insert/sparklystarnew.gif\"></span><span>Which, for the past six years, is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/technology/secret-court-ruling-put-tech-companies-in-data-bind.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0\">exactly what happened to Yahoo</a>.

Instead of blindly accepting the government’s constitutionally qu</span><span>estionable order, Yahoo fought back. The company challenged the legality of the order in the FISC, the secret surveillance court that grants government applications for surveillance</span><span>. And when the order was u</span><span>pheld by the FISC, Yahoo didn’t stop fighting: it appealed the decision to the Foreign Intelligenc</span><span>e </span><span>Surveillance Court of Review, a three-judge appellate court established to review decisions of the FISC.</span><p><span>Ultimately, the Court of Review <a href=\"https://www.fas.org/irp/agency/doj/fisa/fiscr082208.pdf\">ruled against Yahoo</a>, upholding the constitutionality of the Protect America Act and ordering Yahoo to turn over the user data the government requested. The details of the data turned over, and even the full opinion of the Court of Review, remain secret (a redacted version of the court’s opinion was released in 2008). Indeed, the fact that Yahoo was involved in the case was a secret until the <em>New York Times </em><a href=\"http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/secret-court-declassifies-yahoos-role-in-disclosure-fight/\">revealed it</a> earlier this month. Following the <em>Times </em>article and <a href=\"http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/105b-g-07-01-motion-130614.pdf\">a new motion</a> for disclosure by Yahoo, the government <a href=\"http://www.uscourts.gov/uscourts/courts/fisc/105b-g-07-01-motion-130625.pdf\">acknowledged</a> that more information could be made available about the case, including the fact that Yahoo was involved. </span><p><span>After six years of silence, Yahoo is finally able to speak publicly about its fight.</span><p><span>Yahoo went to bat for its users – not because it had to, and not because of a possible PR benefit – but because it was the right move for its users and the company. It’s precisely this type of fight – a secret fight for user privacy – that should serve as the gold standard for companies, and such a fight must be commended. While Yahoo still has a way to go in the other Who Has Your Back <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/who-has-your-back-2013\">categories</a> (and they remain the last major email carrier not using HTTPS encryption by default), Yahoo leads the pack in fighting for its users under seal and in secret.</span><p>Of course, it's possible more companies have challeneged this secret surveillance, but we just don't know about it yet. We encourage every company that has opposed a FISA order or directive to move to unseal their oppositions so the public will have a better understanding of how they've fought for their users.<p>Until then, we hope Yahoo's star will serve as a beacon for all companies: fighting for your users' privacy is the right thing to do, even if you can't let them know.<p> \n</div></div></div><div><div>Related Issues: </div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying\">NSA Spying</a></div></div></div><div><br>Share this: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=Yahoo%27s+Fight+for+its+Users+in+Secret+Court+Earns+the+Company+Special+Recognition+in+Who+Has+Your+Back+Survey++https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fyahoo-fight-for-users-earns-company-special-recognition\"><img alt=\"Share on Twitter\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/twitter.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fyahoo-fight-for-users-earns-company-special-recognition&t=Yahoo%27s+Fight+for+its+Users+in+Secret+Court+Earns+the+Company+Special+Recognition+in+Who+Has+Your+Back+Survey+\"><img alt=\"Share on Facebook\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/facebook.gif\"></a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fyahoo-fight-for-users-earns-company-special-recognition\"><img alt=\"Share on Google+\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/gplus-16.png\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://identi.ca/notice/new?status_textarea=Yahoo%27s+Fight+for+its+Users+in+Secret+Court+Earns+the+Company+Special+Recognition+in+Who+Has+Your+Back+Survey++https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fyahoo-fight-for-users-earns-company-special-recognition\"><img alt=\"Share on Identi.ca\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/identica.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=Yahoo%27s Fight for its Users in Secret Court Earns the Company Special Recognition in Who Has Your Back Survey &url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fyahoo-fight-for-users-earns-company-special-recognition\"><img alt=\"Share on Diaspora\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/diaspora-16.png\"></a>  ||  <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/join\">Join EFF</a></div>","direction":"ltr"},"author":"Mark Rumold","alternate":[{"href":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/yahoo-fight-for-users-earns-company-special-recognition","type":"text/html"}],"origin":{"htmlUrl":"https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml","streamId":"feed/https://www.eff.org/rss/updates.xml","title":"Deeplinks"},"unread":true},{"id":"55jQyVFBayOwBJQ5qCX8DsgTPumTnzjw6LozTAKPiWA=_13fe161ce88:78394e:c159ab3d","originId":"74972 at https://www.eff.org","fingerprint":"6f04dad6","title":"Bills Introduced by Congress Fail to Fix Unconstitutional NSA Spying","published":1373872618000,"crawled":1373875850888,"summary":{"content":"<div><div><div><p>In the past two weeks Congress has introduced a slew of bills responding to the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order\"><em>Guardian</em></a>'s publication of a <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/confirmed-nsa-spying-millions-americans\">top secret court order</a> using <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/foia/section-215-usa-patriot-act\">Section 215</a> of the PATRIOT Act to demand that Verizon Business Network Services give the National Security Agency (NSA)<i> </i>a record of <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/confirmed-nsa-spying-millions-americans\"><i>every</i> customer's call history</a><i> </i>for three months. The order was confirmed by officials like President Obama and Senator Feinstein, who said it was a \"routine\" 90 day reauthorization of a program started in 2007.\n<p>Currently, four bills have been introduced to fix the problem: one by <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/leahy-nsa-spying-fix\">Senator Leahy</a>, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/sanders-nsa-spying\">Senator Sanders</a>, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/udall-wyden-nsa-spying\">Senators Udall and Wyden</a>, and <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/document/conyers-nsa-spying-bill\">Rep. Conyers</a>. The well-intentioned bills try to address the Justice Department's (DOJ) abusive interpretations of Section 215 (more formally, <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/1861\">50 USC § 1861</a>) apparently approved by the reclusive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court) in <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/foia/fisc-orders-illegal-government-sureveillance\">secret legal opinions</a>.\n<p>Sadly, all of them fail to fix the problem of unconstitutional domestic spying—not only because they ignore the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/what-we-need-to-know-about-prism\">PRISM</a> program, which uses Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) and collects Americans' emails and phone calls—but because the legislators simply don't have key information about how the government interprets and uses the statute. <em>Congress must find out more about the programs before it can propose fixes.</em> That's why a <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/campaign-end-nsa-warrantless-surveillance-surges-past-500000-signers\">coalition of over 100 civil liberties groups</a> and <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/stopwatching.us/?r=eff\">over half a million people</a> are pushing for a special congressional investigatory committee, more transparency, and more accountability.\n<h3>More Information Needed</h3>\n<p>The American public has not seen the secret law and legal opinions supposedly justifying the unconstitutional NSA spying. Just this week the <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html?_r=0\"><i>New York Times </i></a>and <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323873904578571893758853344.html\"><i>Wall Street Journal</i></a> (paywall) reported that the secret law includes dozens of opinions—some of which are hundreds of pages long—gutting the Fourth Amendment. The special investigative committee must find out necessary information about the programs and about the opinions. Or, at the very least, extant committees like the Judiciary or Oversight Committees must conduct more open hearings and release more information to the public. Either way, the process must start with the publication of the secret legal opinions of the FISA Court, and the opinions drafted by the Department of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC).\n<h3>Why the Legislation Fails to Fix Section 215</h3>\n<p>Some of the bills try to narrow Section 215 by heightening the legal standard for the government to access information. Currently, the FBI can obtain \"any tangible thing\"—including, surprisingly, intangible business records about Americans—that is \"relevant\"\n<blockquote><p>to an authorized investigation to obtain foreign intelligence information not concerning a US person or to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities</blockquote>\n<p>with a statement of facts showing that there are \"reasonable grounds to believe\" that the tangible things are \"relevant\" to such an investigation. Bills by Rep. Conyers and Sen. Sanders attempt to heighten the standard by using pre-9/11 language mandating \"specific and articulable facts\" about why the FBI needs the records. Rep. Conyers goes one step further than Sen. Sanders by forcing the FBI to include why the records are \"material,\" or significantly relevant, to an investigation.\n<p>By heightening the legal standard, the legislators intend for the FBI to show exactly why a mass database of calling records is relevant to an investigation. But it's impossible to know if these fixes will stop the unconstitutional spying without knowing how the government defines key terms in the bills. The bills by Sen. Leahy and Sens. Udall and Wyden do not touch this part of the law.\n<h3>Failure to Stop the Unconstitutional Collection of \"Bulk Records\"</h3>\n<p>Sens. Udall, Wyden, and Leahy use a different approach; their bills mandate every order include why the records \"pertain to\" an individual or are \"relevant to\" an investigation. Collectively this aims—but most likely fails—to stop the government from issuing \"bulk records orders\" like the Verizon order. Senator Sanders travels a different path by requiring the government specify why \"each of\" the business records is related to an investigation; however, it's also unclear if this stops the spying. Yet again, Rep. Conyers bill provides the strongest language as it deletes ambiguous clauses and forces all requests \"pertain only to\" an individual; however even the strongest language found in these bills will probably not stop the unconstitutional spying.\n<h3>Legislators Are Drafting in the Dark</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, legislators are trying to edit the statutory text before a thorough understanding of how the government is using key definitions in the bill or how the FISA Court is interpreting the statute. For instance, take the word \"relevant.\" The \"tangible thing\" produced under a Section 215 order must be \"relevant\" to the specific type of investigation mentioned above. But the Verizon order requires <i>every</i> Verizon customer's call history.\n<p>The <a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html?_r=0\"><em>New York Times</em></a> confirmed the secret FISA court was persuaded by the government that this information is somehow relevant to such an investigation. The <i><a target=\"_self\" href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323873904578571893758853344.html\"><i>Wall Street Journal</i></a> </i>(paywall)<i>, </i>quoting \"people familiar with the [FISA Court] rulings\" wrote: \"According to the [FISA Court], the special nature of national-security and terrorism-prevention cases means 'relevant' can have a broader meaning for those investigations.\" Obviously, only severely strained legalese—similar to the Department of Justice's re-definition of \"<a href=\"http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/02/04/16843014-justice-department-memo-reveals-legal-case-for-drone-strikes-on-americans?lite\">imminent</a>\"—could justify such an argument. And the Fourth Amendment was created to protect against this exact thing—vague, overbroad \"<a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://www.eff.org/files/filenode/att/generalwarrantsmemo.pdf\">general warrants</a>\" (.pdf).\n<p>If \"relevant\" has been defined to permit bulk data collection, requiring more or better facts about <em>why</em> is unlikely to matter. Even Sen. Sanders's approach—which would require \"each\" record be related to an investigation—could fall short if \"relevance\" is evaluated in terms of the database as a whole, rather than its individual records. This is just one example of why the secret FISA Court decisions and OLC opinions must be released. Without them, legislators cannot perform one of their jobs: writing legislation.\n<h3>Congress Must Obtain and Release the Secret Law</h3>\n<p>The actions revealed by the government strike at the very core of our Constitution. Further, the majority of Congress is unaware about the specific language and legal interpretations used to justify the spying. Without this information, Congress can only legislate in the dark. It's time for Congress to investigate these matters to the fullest extent possible. American privacy should not be held hostage by secrecy. <a target=\"_self\" href=\"https://eff.org/fight-nsa\">Tell Congress now</a> to push for an special investigative committee, more transparency, and more accountability.\n</div></div></div><div><div>Related Issues: </div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying\">NSA Spying</a></div></div></div><div><br>Share this: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=Bills+Introduced+by+Congress+Fail+to+Fix+Unconstitutional+NSA+Spying+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fbills-fail-fix-unconstitutional-nsa-spying\"><img alt=\"Share on Twitter\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/twitter.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fbills-fail-fix-unconstitutional-nsa-spying&t=Bills+Introduced+by+Congress+Fail+to+Fix+Unconstitutional+NSA+Spying\"><img alt=\"Share on Facebook\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/facebook.gif\"></a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fbills-fail-fix-unconstitutional-nsa-spying\"><img alt=\"Share on Google+\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/gplus-16.png\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://identi.ca/notice/new?status_textarea=Bills+Introduced+by+Congress+Fail+to+Fix+Unconstitutional+NSA+Spying+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fbills-fail-fix-unconstitutional-nsa-spying\"><img alt=\"Share on Identi.ca\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/identica.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=Bills Introduced by Congress Fail to Fix Unconstitutional NSA Spying&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fbills-fail-fix-unconstitutional-nsa-spying\"><img alt=\"Share on Diaspora\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/diaspora-16.png\"></a>  ||  <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/join\">Join EFF</a></div>","direction":"ltr"},"author":"Mark M.

The new reports are quite disturbing to anyone who cares about the Fourth Amendment, and they only underscore the need for major reform.\n<p>As the <i>New York Times</i> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/in-secret-court-vastly-broadens-powers-of-nsa.html?_r=0&pagewanted=all\">reported on its front page</a> on Sunday, “In more than a dozen classified rulings, the nation’s surveillance court has created a secret body of law giving the <a title=\"More articles about National Security Agency, U.S.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_security_agency/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">National Security Agency</a> the power to amass vast collections of data on Americans.” The court, which was originally set up to just approve or deny wiretap requests now “has taken on a much more expansive role by regularly assessing broad constitutional questions and establishing important judicial precedents,” with no opposing counsel to offer counter arguments to the government, and rulings that cannot be appealed outside its secret structure. “It has quietly become almost a parallel Supreme Court,” reported the <i>Times</i>.\n<p><i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB10001424127887323873904578571893758853344-lMyQjAxMTAzMDAwNzEwNDcyWj.html\">reported on one of the court’s</a> most controversial decisions (or at least one of the controversial decisions we know of), in which it radically re-interpreted the word “relevant” in Section 215 of the Patriot Act to allow for the dragnet collection of every phone call record in the United States.\n<p>The <i>Journal</i> explained:\n<blockquote><p>The history of the word \"relevant\" is key to understanding that passage. The Supreme Court in 1991 said things are \"relevant\" if there is a \"reasonable possibility\" that they will produce information related to the subject of the investigation. In criminal cases, courts previously have found that very large sets of information didn't meet the relevance standard because significant portions—innocent people's information—wouldn't be pertinent.\n<p>But the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, FISC, has developed separate precedents, centered on the idea that investigations to prevent national-security threats are different from ordinary criminal cases. The court's rulings on such matters are classified and almost impossible to challenge because of the secret nature of the proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p>Essentially, the court re-defined the word “relevant” to mean “anything and everything.” Sens. Ron Wyden and Mark Udall explained two years ago on the Senate floor that Americans would be shocked if they knew how the government was interpreting the Patriot Act. This is exactly what they were talking about.\n<p>It’s likely the precedent laid down in the last few years will stay law for years to come if the courts are not reformed. FISA judges <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-07-02/chief-justice-roberts-is-awesome-power-behind-fisa-court.html\">are appointed by one unelected official</a> who holds lifetime office: the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Under current law, for the coming decades, Chief Justice John Roberts will solely decide who will write the sweeping surveillance opinions few will be allowed to read, but which everyone will be subject to.\n<p>Judge James Robertson was once one of those judges. He was appointed to the court in the mid-2000s. He confirmed yesterday for the first time that he resigned in 2005 in protest of the Bush administration illegally bypassing the court altogether. Since Robertson retired, however, the court has transitioned from being ignored to wielding enormous, undemocratic power.\n<p>“What FISA does is not adjudication, but approval,” <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/law/2013/jul/09/fisa-courts-judge-nsa-surveillance\">Judge Robertson said</a>. “This works just fine when it deals with individual applications for warrants, but the [FISA Amendments Act of 2008] has turned the FISA court into administrative agency making rules for others to follow.”\n<p>Under the FISA Amendments Act, \"the court is now approving programmatic surveillance. I don't think that is a judicial function.” He continued, \"Anyone who has been a judge will tell you a judge needs to hear both sides of a case…This process needs an adversary.\"\n<p>No opposing counsel, rulings handed down in complete secrecy by judges appointed by an unelected official, and no way for those affected to appeal. As <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2013/07/secret-government?fsrc=scn/tw_ec/america_against_democracy\"><i>The Economist </i>stated</a>,  “Sounds a lot like the sort of thing authoritarian governments set up when they make a half-hearted attempt to create the appearance of the rule of law.”\n<p>This scandal should precipitate many reforms, but one thing is certain: FISA rulings need to be made public so the American people understand how courts are interpreting their constitutional rights. The very idea of democratic law depends on it.\n<p> \n</div></div></div><div><div>Related Issues: </div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying\">NSA Spying</a></div></div></div><div><div>Related Cases: </div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/cases/jewel\">Jewel v.

On June 15, police began using <a href=\"http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2013/06/30/Police-use-tear-gas-water-cannons-in-Turkey-protests/UPI-13041372608490/\">tear gas and water cannons</a> to clear out the large encampment in the park. But this effort also has stretched beyond episodes of physical violence and police brutality into the digital world, where information control and media intimidation are on the rise.\n<p>Since the protests began, dozens of Turkish social media users <a href=\"http://advocacy.globalvoicesonline.org/2013/06/07/as-protests-continue-turkey-cracks-down-on-twitter-users/\">have been detained</a> on charges ranging from <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/international/world/turkey-cracks-down-on-twitter-users/article4784440.ece\">inciting demonstrations, to spreading propaganda</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/05/world/europe/turkey-protests/\">false information</a>, to <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/27/turkey-investigates-social-media_n_3509365.html?utm_hp_ref=technology&ir=Technology\">insulting government officials</a>. Dozens more Twitter users were reportedly arrested for posting images of <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/turkish-police-arrest-twitter-users-2013-6\">police brutality</a>, though the legal pretense for these arrests is unclear. A recent ruling in an Ankara court ordered 22 demonstrators detained on <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/europe/2013/06/201362216245060913.html\">terrorism-related charges</a>.\n<p>Prime Minister Erdogan made his view of social media known when he described social media as “<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2013/06/03/turkey_protests_prime_minister_erdogan_blames_twitter_calls_social_media.html\">the worst menace to society</a>” at a June press conference. It is worth noting that <a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/europe/turkey/130629/turkey-twitter-facebook-social-media-erdogan-taksim-bbc-turkce#1\">Erdogan himself is said to maintain a Twitter account with over 3 million followers and 2,000 tweets</a> (some Turks question whether the unverified account is really him, or an unofficial supporter.) While the Turkish government has had <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/06/18/turkey-vows-to-strengthen-police-powers/2433709/\">limited</a>, <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/middleeast/2013/06/03/amid-turkey-unrest-social-media-becomes-a-battleground/\">if any</a>, involvement in tampering with social media access thus far, government officials appear eager to take further action.\n<p><strong>Roots in traditional media</strong>\n<p>Although current circumstances appear to be testing the limits of Turkey’s information policy framework, the country has a long history of restrictive media policy and practice. In 2013, Turkey ranked <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/spip.php?page=classement&id_rubrique=1054\">154 out of 166</a> on the Reporters Without Borders’ Annual Worldwide Press Freedom Index, due in part to the fact that since 1992 <a href=\"http://cpj.org/killed/europe/turkey/\">18 journalists have been murdered</a> there, 14 with impunity. In responding to protest coverage, authorities have <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/2013/06/turkey-fines-tv-stations-in-connection-with-protes.php\">fined</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/2013/06/in-crackdown-on-dissent-turkey-detains-press-raids.php\">detained</a> and even <a href=\"http://www.cpj.org/2013/06/journalists-detained-beaten-obstructed-in-istanbul.php\">beaten</a> members of the press. Institutional censorship has also been prevalent: When clashes between protesters and police escalated, activists noted that <a href=\"http://news.yahoo.com/pinned-under-governments-thumb-turkish-media-covers-penguins-124645832.html\">CNN Turk</a> aired a documentary on penguins <a href=\"http://www.dailydot.com/news/cnn-turk-istanbul-riots-penguin-doc-social-media/\">while CNN International</a> ran live coverage of the events in Taksim Square.\n<p><span>Dubbed the “</span><span><a href=\"https://en.rsf.org/turkey-turkey-world-s-biggest-prison-for-19-12-2012,43816.html\">the world’s biggest prison for journalists</a></span><span>” by Reporters Without Borders, Turkey has been particularly aggressive in </span><span><a href=\"http://www.opendemocracy.net/anna-bragga/turkey-media-crisis-how-anti-terrorism-laws-equip-war-on-dissent\">arresting Kurdish journalists under Turkey’s anti-terrorism law</a></span><span> known as Terörle Mücadele Yasası.</span>\n<p><strong>Controlling digital expression</strong>\n<p>As of 2012, <a href=\"http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/icteye/DisplayCountry.aspx?code=TUR\">45% of Turkey’s population</a> had regular access to the Internet. The country’s leading ISP, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C3%BCrk_Telekom\">Türk Telekom (TT)</a>, formerly a government-controlled monopoly, was privatized in 2005 but retained a <a href=\"https://opennet.net/research/profiles/turkey#footnote6_oj6yz7g\">95% percent market share in 2007</a>. Türk Telekom also controls the country’s only commercial backbone.\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mevzuat.gov.tr/Metin.Aspx?MevzuatKod=1.5.5651&MevzuatIliski=0&sourceXmlSearch=\">Internet Law No. 5651</a>, passed in 2007, <a href=\"http://sites.psu.edu/comm410censorshipinturkey/literature-review/\">prohibits online content</a> in eight categories including <a href=\"https://opennet.net/research/profiles/turkey\">prostituion, sexual abuse of children, facilitation of the abuse of drugs, and crimes against (or insults to) Atatürk</a>. The law authorizes the Turkish Supreme Council for Telecommunications and IT (TIB) to block a website when it has “adequate suspicion” that the site hosts illegal content. In 2011, the Council of Europe’s <a href=\"https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=1814085\">Commissioner for Human Rights</a> reported that 80% of online content blocked in Turkey was <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/turkey-turkey-11-03-2011,39758.html\">due to decisions made by the TIB</a>, with the remaining 20% being blocked as the result of orders by Turkey’s traditional court system. In 2009 alone, nearly <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/surveillance-turkey,39758.html\">200 court decisions</a> found TIB decisions to block websites unjustifiable because they fell outside the scope of Law 5651. The law also has been criticized for authorizing takedowns of entire sites when only a small portion of their content stands in violation of the law.\n<p>Between 2008 and 2010, YouTube was blocked in its entirety under Law 5651 because of specific videos that fell into the category of “crimes against Atatürk”. During this period, YouTube continued to be the <a href=\"http://cyberlaw.org.uk/2008/11/27/tdn-banned-youtube-still-in-top-10-in-turkey/\">10th most visited site</a> in Turkey, with users accessing the site through proxies. The ban was eventually lifted when YouTube removed the videos in question and came under compliance with Turkish law. Sites likes Blogspot, Metacafe, Wix and others have gone through similar ordeals in Turkey in recent years. An estimated <a href=\"http://engelliweb.com/\">31,000 websites are blocked</a> in the country.\n<p>In December 2012, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/12/european-human-rights-court-finds-turkey-violation-freedom-expression\">found</a> that Turkey had violated their citizen’s right to free expression by blocking <a href=\"http://sites.google.com\">Google Sites</a>. While Turkey justified the ban based on Sites’ hosting of websites that violated Law 5651, the ECHR found that Turkish law did not allow for “wholesale blocking of access” to a hosting provider like Google Sites. Furthermore, Google Sites had not been informed that it was hosting “illegal” content.\n<p>In 2011, Turkey <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/11/week-internet-censorship-opaque-censorship-turkey-russia-and-britain\">proposed a mandatory online filtering system</a> described as an effort to protect minors and families. This new system, dubbed Güvenli İnternet, or Secure Internet, would block any website that contained keywords from a list of <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/turkey-online-censorship-now-bordering-on-29-04-2011,40194.html\">138 terms</a> deemed inappropriate by telecom authority BTK. The plan was met with public backlash and <a href=\"http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9216750/Protests_in_Turkey_against_Internet_controls\">protests</a> causing the government to re-evaluate the system and eventually offer it as an opt-in service. While only <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/turkey-turkey-12-03-2012,42065.html\">22,000 of Turkey’s 11 million Internet users</a> have so far opted for the system, opponents of Güvenli İnternet decry it as a <a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/turquie-new-internet-filtering-system-02-12-2011,41498.html\">form of censorship, </a><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fen.rsf.org%2Fturquie-new-internet-filtering-system-02-12-2011%2C41498.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGpw5o8xnE47-LjuK_fvBbtgt5Row\">disguised </a><a href=\"http://en.rsf.org/turquie-new-internet-filtering-system-02-12-2011,41498.html\">as an effort to protect children</a> and families from “objectionable content”.\n<p><strong>New policies could further restrict social networks</strong>\n<p>As the protests continue, the Turkish government is working to use legal tools already at its disposal to increase control over social network activity. Transportation and Communications Minister Binali Yildirim has called on Twitter to establish a <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/26/net-us-turkey-protests-twitter-idUSBRE95P0XC20130626\">representative office within the country</a>. Legally, this could give the Turkish government greater ability to obtain user data from the company. But these requests have not received a warm response from Twitter, which has developed a <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fwho-has-your-back-2013&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNEv4KpiTWJHxBwMpjfO3nW7kaiNHw\">reputation for protecting user data</a> in the face of government requests. While Twitter has “<a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/minister-says-twitter-turned-down-cooperation-offer-over-turkey-protests.aspx?pageID=238&nID=49496&NewsCatID=374\">turned down</a>” requests from the Turkish government for user data and general cooperation, Minister Yildirim stated that Facebook had <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2013/06/facebook-and-twitter-refuse-to-cooperate-with-turkish-govt-crackdown-on-protesters/\">responded “positively</a>”. Shortly thereafter, Facebook published a <a href=\"https://newsroom.fb.com/fact-check\">“Fact Check”</a> post that denied cooperation with Turkish officials.\n<p>Turkey’s Interior Minister Muammer Güler told journalists that “<a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/governement-working-on-draft-to-restrict-social-media-in-turkey.aspx?pageID=238&nID=48982&NewsCatID=338#.UcCVIc-KyUs.twitter\">the issue [of social media] needs a separate regulation</a>” and Deputy <a href=\"http://www.worldbulletin.net/?aType=haber&ArticleID=111568\">Prime Minister Bozdag stated that the government had no intention of placing an outright ban</a> on social media, but indicated a desire to <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-20/turkey-announces-plan-to-restrict-fake-social-media-accounts.html\">outlaw “fake” social media accounts</a>. Sources have confirmed that the <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/27/turkey-investigates-social-media_n_3509365.html?utm_hp_ref=technology&ir=Technology\">Justice Ministry is conducting research and drafting legislation on the issue</a>.\n<p>New media expert Ozgur Uckan of Istanbul’s Bilgi University <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/parallels/2013/06/26/195889178/thanks-but-no-social-media-refuses-to-share-with-turkey\">noted that</a> “censoring social media sites presents a technical challenge, and that may be why officials are talking about criminalizing certain content, in an effort to intimidate users and encourage self-censorship.”\n<p>While the details of <a href=\"http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action;jsessionid=F3B400500B268D2945E03E7F4BF27331?newsId=318800&columnistId=0\">these new laws </a>remain to be seen, it is likely that they will have some impact on journalistic and activist activities in the country, especially in times of rising public protest and dissent.\n</div></div></div><div><div>Related Issues: </div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/free-speech\">Free Speech</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/bloggers-under-fire\">Bloggers Under Fire</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/international\">International</a></div></div></div><div><br>Share this: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=Online+and+Off%2C+Information+Control+Persists+in+Turkey+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fonline-and-information-control-persists-turkey\"><img alt=\"Share on Twitter\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/twitter.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fonline-and-information-control-persists-turkey&t=Online+and+Off%2C+Information+Control+Persists+in+Turkey\"><img alt=\"Share on Facebook\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/facebook.gif\"></a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fonline-and-information-control-persists-turkey\"><img alt=\"Share on Google+\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/gplus-16.png\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://identi.ca/notice/new?status_textarea=Online+and+Off%2C+Information+Control+Persists+in+Turkey+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fonline-and-information-control-persists-turkey\"><img alt=\"Share on Identi.ca\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/identica.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=Online and Off%2C Information Control Persists in Turkey&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fonline-and-information-control-persists-turkey\"><img alt=\"Share on Diaspora\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/diaspora-16.png\"></a>  ||  <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/join\">Join EFF</a></div>","direction":"ltr"},"unread":true},{"id":"55jQyVFBayOwBJQ5qCX8DsgTPumTnzjw6LozTAKPiWA=_13fcab0b34e:7a49e:9d82f563","originId":"74936 at https://www.eff.org","fingerprint":"73850e04","title":"NSA Leaks Prompt Surveillance Dialogue in India","published":1373493485000,"crawled":1373495145294,"alternate":[{"href":"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/nsa-leaks-prompt-surveillance-dialogue-india","type":"text/html"}],"author":"Jillian C.

The series looks at how the information disclosed in the NSA leaks affect internet users around the world.</em>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As we have discussed throughout our <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/spy-without-borders\">Spies Without Borders</a> series, the backlash against the NSA’s global surveillance programs has been strong. From <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/06/us-government-surveillance-bad-for-silicon-valley-bad-for-democracy-around-the-world/277335/\">Germany</a>, where activists demonstrated against the mass spying, to <a href=\"http://madamasr.com/content/america%E2%80%99s-prism-our-fears-digital-age-come-true\">Egypt</a>—allegedly one of the NSA’s <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/08/nsa-boundless-informant-global-datamining\">top targets</a>—where the reaction is largely the same: “<a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/06/world-us-congress-im-not-american-i-have-privacy-rights\">I’m not American, but I have rights too</a>.”\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Indian commentators are no exception. A piece in the <em>Financial Times</em> stated that the revelations highlighted the “<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/04b972d8-e59b-11e2-ad1a-00144feabdc0,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F04b972d8-e59b-11e2-ad1a-00144feabdc0.html&_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bloomberg.com%2Fnews%2F2013-07-08%2Findians-see-a-gift-in-nsa-leaks.html#axzz2YRT5XQVr\">moral decline of America</a>,” while another in the <em>Hindu</em> <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/indias-cowardly-display-of-servility/article4874219.ece\">berated India</a> for its “servility” toward the U.S.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But the revelations about the NSA’s spying activities have also created an opportunity for Indian activists to speak out about their own country’s practices. As Pranesh Prakash, Policy Director for the Centre for Internet &amp; Society <a href=\"http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-06-13/news/39952596_1_nsa-india-us-homeland-security-dialogue-national-security-letters\">argues in a piece for the <em>Economic Times</em></a>, Indian surveillance laws and practices have been “far worse” than those in the U.S. Writing for <em>Quartz</em>, Nandagopal J. Nair <a href=\"http://qz.com/99019/no-call-email-or-text-will-be-safe-from-indias-surveillance-network/\">agrees</a>, saying that “India’s new surveillance network will make the NSA green with envy.”\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The U.S. has in fact refused Indian requests for real-time access to internet activity routed through U.S.-based Internet sites, and U.S. companies have also <a href=\"http://www.computerweekly.com/news/1280094658/Google-refuses-access-to-Gmail-encryption-for-Indian-government\">stood up to privacy-violating demands</a>. Other companies, such as RIM—the company that owns BlackBerry—have <a href=\"http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2012-10-29/news/34798663_1_interception-solution-blackberry-interception-blackberry-services\">cooperated with the Indian government</a>.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Regulatory privacy protections in India are weak: Telecom companies are required by license to provide data to the government, and the use of encryption is <a href=\"https://www.dot.gov.in/isp/internet-licence-dated%2016-10-2007.pdf\">extremely limited</a>. As we <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/02/disproportionate-state-surveillance-violation-privacy\">have previously explained</a>, India service providers are required to ensure that bulk encryption is not deployed. Additionally, no individual or entity can employ encryption with a key longer than 40 bits. If the encryption surpasses this limit, the individual or entity will need prior written permission from the Department of Telecommunications and must deposit the decryption keys with the <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/07/License%20Agreement%20for%20Provision%20of%20Internet%20Services%20Section%202.2%20(vii)\">Department</a>. The limitation on encryption in India means that technically any encrypted material over 40 bits would be accessible by the State. Ironically, the Reserve Bank of India issues security recommendations that banks should use strong encryption as higher as 128-bit for securing browser. In addition to such limitations on the use of encryption, commentators have also <a href=\"http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/NewDelhi/Concerns-over-central-snoop/Article1-1083658.aspx\">raised concerns</a> about the process for lawful intercept.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The <a href=\"http://qz.com/99019/no-call-email-or-text-will-be-safe-from-indias-surveillance-network/\">latest attempt</a> at surveillance by the Indian government has been <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-surveillance-project-may-be-as-lethal-as-prism/article4834619.ece\">roundly criticized</a> as “more intrusive” than the NSA’s programs. In the <em>New York Times</em>, Prakash <a href=\"http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/how-surveillance-works-in-india/\">explained</a> the new program, the Centralized Monitoring System or C.M.S.:\n<blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">With the C.M.S., the government will get <a href=\"http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/indias-surveillance-project-may-be-as-lethal-as-prism/article4834619.ece\">centralized access to all communications metadata and content</a> traversing through all telecom networks in India. This means that the government can listen to all your calls, track a mobile phone and its user’s location, read all your text messages, personal e-mails and chat conversations. It can also see all your Google searches, Web site visits, usernames and passwords if your communications aren’t encrypted.\n</blockquote>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Notably, India does not have laws allowing for mass surveillance; rather, lawful intercept is covered under the archaic Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 [<a href=\"http://www.ijlt.in/pdffiles/Indian-Telegraph-Act-1885.pdf\">PDF</a>] and the <a href=\"http://www.wipo.int/wipolex/en/text.jsp?file_id=185999\">Information Technology Act of 2000</a> (IT Act). Under both laws, interception must be time-limited and targeted.\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In the <em>Times</em> piece, Prakash also lambasts the IT Act, which he says “very substantially lowers the bar for wiretapping.”  \n<p dir=\"ltr\">All of this points to the fact that our fight for privacy is a shared global challenge; or as a columnist for India’s Sunday Guardian <a href=\"http://www.sunday-guardian.com/technologic/your-freedom-has-just-left-the-building\">recently put it</a>: “We're all now citizens of the surveillance state.”\n</div></div></div><div><div>Related Issues: </div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/international\">International</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/surveillance-human-rights\">State Surveillance &amp; Human Rights</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying\">NSA Spying</a></div></div></div><div><br>Share this: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=NSA+Leaks+Prompt+Surveillance+Dialogue+in+India+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fnsa-leaks-prompt-surveillance-dialogue-india\"><img alt=\"Share on Twitter\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/twitter.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fnsa-leaks-prompt-surveillance-dialogue-india&t=NSA+Leaks+Prompt+Surveillance+Dialogue+in+India\"><img alt=\"Share on Facebook\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/facebook.gif\"></a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fnsa-leaks-prompt-surveillance-dialogue-india\"><img alt=\"Share on Google+\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/gplus-16.png\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://identi.ca/notice/new?status_textarea=NSA+Leaks+Prompt+Surveillance+Dialogue+in+India+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fnsa-leaks-prompt-surveillance-dialogue-india\"><img alt=\"Share on Identi.ca\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/identica.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=NSA Leaks Prompt Surveillance Dialogue in India&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Fnsa-leaks-prompt-surveillance-dialogue-india\"><img alt=\"Share on Diaspora\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/diaspora-16.png\"></a>  ||  <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/join\">Join EFF</a></div>","direction":"ltr"},"unread":true}]}
