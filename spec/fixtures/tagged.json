What is far more important is the evidence that IPNav's business, and patent trolling more generally, is a huge tax on innovation.\n<p>Thanks to trolls like IPNav, the <em>Times</em> explains, U.S. companies are forced to spend upwards of $30 billion every year on patent litigation. Most of that money goes to troll profits and legal expenses, with less than 25 percent flowing to inventors. Even Spangenberg concedes that his business uses “the courts as a marketplace, and the courts are horribly inefficient and horribly expensive as a market.” Patent trolls like IPNav are a symptom of a fundamentally broken system.\n<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/business/how-a-typical-patent-battle-took-an-unexpected-turn.html\">follow up article</a>, the <em>Times</em> tells the story of Peter Braxton and his app <a href=\"http://jumpropetheapp.com/\">Jump Rope</a>. In an <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/ciocentral/2013/01/17/are-patent-trolls-now-zeroed-in-on-start-ups/\">all too common tale</a>, Braxton's promising start-up was devastated by a troll lawsuit (brought by a company not associated with IPNav). Even though Braxton won a clear victory at the district court, litigation costs were destroying his business. In exchange for a substantial equity stake in Braxton's company, IPNav agreed to handle the litigation. As the <em>Times</em> explained, this story suggests that “there is really only one way to deal with a patent bully: team up with a bigger bully.”\n<p>This is a terrible climate for innovation. We hope that media attention like this helps spur <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/legislative-solutions-patent-reform\">legislative reform</a>. We should create a patent system that doesn't squelch start-ups solely to enrich patent trolls. Erich Spangenberg doesn't need a seventh Lamborghini.\n</div></div></div><div><div>Related Issues: </div><div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/innovation\">Innovation</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/patent\">Patents</a></div><div><a href=\"https://www.eff.org/issues/resources-patent-troll-victims\">Patent Trolls</a></div></div></div><div><br>Share this: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/home?status=The+Times+Profiles+a+Patent+Troll+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Ftimes-profiles-patent-troll\"><img alt=\"Share on Twitter\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/twitter.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Ftimes-profiles-patent-troll&t=The+Times+Profiles+a+Patent+Troll\"><img alt=\"Share on Facebook\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/facebook.gif\"></a> <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Ftimes-profiles-patent-troll\"><img alt=\"Share on Google+\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/gplus-16.png\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://identi.ca/notice/new?status_textarea=The+Times+Profiles+a+Patent+Troll+https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Ftimes-profiles-patent-troll\"><img alt=\"Share on Identi.ca\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/identica.gif\"></a> <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://sharetodiaspora.github.com/?title=The Times Profiles a Patent Troll&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eff.org%2Fdeeplinks%2F2013%2F07%2Ftimes-profiles-patent-troll\"><img alt=\"Share on Diaspora\" src=\"https://www.eff.org/sites/all/themes/frontier/images/share/diaspora-16.png\"></a>  ||  <a href=\"https://supporters.eff.org/join\">Join EFF</a></div>","direction":"ltr"},"unread":false,"tags":[{"id":"user/00000000-000-NOT-VALID-a29b6679bb3c/tag/global.saved","label":""},{"id":"user/00000000-000-NOT-VALID-a29b6679bb3c/tag/global.read","label":"global.read"}],"actionTimestamp":1373946246300}]}
